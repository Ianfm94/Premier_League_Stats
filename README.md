# Premier_League_Stats Repository

This repository is made up of four subfolders:
 
 ## Barchart Race Folder ##
  This folder includes a (really bad, I need to update this) Barchart Race detailing the TOP 25 PL Goalscorers on a season  \
  by season basis and a CSV file with the data needed to make the Barchart Race.
 
 ## CSV Files ##
  This folder includes some CSV files which include weekly FPL data webscraped from the FPL website. Will be updated weekly \
  going forward.
  
 ## Stats ##
  This folder includes two csv files with the current top goalscorers and the current top assist makers in the PL (as of 10/06/20).

 ## Fantasy_Football ##
  This folder contains three interactive graphs and the R code on how to create the aforementioned graphs:
  
  One of the top 20 Premier League Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
  One of the top 100 Premier League Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
  One of the Manchester United Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
