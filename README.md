# Premier_League_Stats Repository

This repository is made up of four subfolders:
 
 ## Barchart Race Folder ##
  This folder includes a (really bad, I need to update this) Barchart Race detailing the Top 25 PL Goalscorers on a season  \
  by season basis and a CSV file with the data needed to make the Barchart Race.
 
 ## CSV Files ##
  This folder includes some CSV files which include weekly FPL data webscraped from the FPL website. Will be updated weekly \
  going forward.
  
 ## Stats ##
  This folder includes two csv files and the R script on how to make the below three graphs:
  * One of the csv fildes contains the current top goalscorers & the current top combined players with goals & assists.
  * The other csv file includes the current top assist makers in the PL.
  * Both files data is of 10/06/2020.

 ## Fantasy_Football ##
  This folder contains three interactive graphs and the R code on how to create the aforementioned graphs:
  
  * One of the top 20 Premier League Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
  * One of the top 100 Premier League Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
  * One of the Manchester United Fantasy Point Scorers so far this season.
