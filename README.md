#**Premier_League_Stats Repository**

This repository is made up of two folders:
  
  One with a Barchart Race detailing the TOP 25 PL Goalscorers on a season by season basis. 
  Another with some basic statistics about the PL, such as all time top goal-scorer, alltime assist leader and finally a combined all time 
  PL goals and assists. This includes the raw data and some graphs too.
  
  An interactive graph of the top 20 Premier League Top Fantasy Point Scorers is saved at the below location, it's broken down by player     position and colour coded by each player's team:
