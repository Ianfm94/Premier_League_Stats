# Premier_League_Stats Repository

This repository is made up of four subfolders:
 
 ## Barchart Race Folder ##
  This folder includes a (really bad, I need to update this) Barchart Race detailing the TOP 25 PL Goalscorers on a season  \
  by season basis and a CSV file with the data needed to make the Barchart Race.
 
 ## CSV Files ##
  This folder includes some CSV files which include weekly FPL data webscraped from the FPL website. Will be updated weekly \
  going forward.
  
 ## Stats ##
  This folder includes two csv files with the current top goalscorers and the current top assist makers in the PL (as of 10/06/20).
