**Premier_League_Stats Repository**

This repository is made up of two folders:
  
  One with a Barchart Race detailing the TOP 25 PL Goalscorers on a season by season basis. 
  Another with some basic statistics about the PL, such as all time top goal-scorer, alltime assist leader and finally a combined all time 
  PL goals and assists. This includes the raw data and some graphs too.
